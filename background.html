<h2>ِAbout me</h2><br/><br/><br/>
<p>My name is Salman Abdullah Alnafea, a 23-year-old student specializing in Computer Science at Al Qassim University, where I have been enrolled since 2020. My expected graduation year is 2026.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve been deeply motivated to build a strong foundation in technology and software development. I am currently undergoing professional training with Smart Methods, a company known for its focus on innovation and real-world application of technical skills. This opportunity is helping me further develop both my practical experience and industry awareness.

My objective is clear: to push my professional career to its full potential by continuously learning, improving, and contributing to impactful projects. I have already worked on multiple academic and personal projects during my time at the university. If you're interested in exploring some of my work, feel free to visit the "My Projects" page.</p>
