#This website is about me and what have I accomplished
#At first you have 3 choices
#1- to look at my background
#2- to see my previous projects
#3- to look at my skills
#And you can always check my social media at the footer (Github - Linkedin - Email)
#in my background you can learn more about me and you can choose to go back to the previous page
#in my previous projects you can see the projects I worked on and you can choose to go back to the previous page
#in my skills you can see my social and technical skills and you can see my programing languages
